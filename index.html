    <p>Apple’s hugely popular smartwatches are on many iPhone owners’ wrists for a reason. They offer unmatched smart features, good fitness tracking, and receive regular updates.</p></div>

    <p>The Apple Watch is a smartwatch made by Apple, the same company that makes the iPhone. Apple Watches are extremely popular around the world. They’re only compatible with iPhones — sorry Android users — and offer many tie-ins with Apple’s ecosystem. Whether you’re talking with a friend in iMessage or navigating with Apple Maps, the Apple Watch will provide the best smartwatch experience for your iPhone.

        Unlike some other major smartwatch platforms, Apple produces the hardware and software for the Apple Watch. This means the company can issue major hardware refreshes and regular software updates without the need to wait on a third-party company for approval. This contrasts with Google’s Wear OS platform; Google is in charge of the Wear OS software, but it doesn’t actually make Wear OS hardware. Thus, the Apple Watch tends to offer a more polished, cohesive experience.

        <p>There are many reasons to buy an Apple Watch over competing smartwatches. If you own an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the smartwatch you should check out first.

            First and foremost, the Apple Watch is a great smartwatch. It comes with Siri, allows you to control smart home devices from your wrist, and you can even answer calls and respond to messages. There are plenty of third-party apps, too, so most of the apps you use on your iPhone are likely available for the Apple Watch</p>
            
            
            <p>Fitness and health features vary from device to device. Most Apple Watch devices support all the features on the list below, though there are some exceptions.

                Steps: All Apple Watches will keep track of your step count throughout the day. During walking activities, your Apple Watch can also track your double support time (% of time both feet are on the ground), step length, and walking speed.
                Distance: Apple Watches will track your running and walking distance. The Apple Health app lets you view your distance in miles or kilometers. All Apple watches except the first-gen and Series 1 models will keep track of your distance during activities with standalone GPS. Series 1 and first-gen models only support connected GPS, so you’ll need to bring your iPhone on a run if you want decent distance data.
                Floors climbed: Modern Apple Watches will track the number of floors you climb during the day. Series 3-5 have altimeters built-in. Series 7, 6 and SE models sport an always-on altimeter, which will update more frequently throughout the day — perfect if you’re into hiking or trail running. Apple Health will also display the speed at which you ascend and descend flights of stairs.
                Calories burned: Apple Watches will track your resting and active calorie burn throughout the day, using your age, height, weight, and gender. If you want to track your food intake or nutrition, we suggest downloading a third-party app like MyFitnessPal instead of using Apple Health’s built-in Nutrition tab</p>
